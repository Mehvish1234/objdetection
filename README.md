- **Multi-class Detection**: Detects three critical object types: FireExtinguisher, ToolBox, OxygenTank
- **Web-based Interface**: Accessible from any modern browser on computer or mobile devices
- **Download Results**: Save annotated images with detection overlays
- **Model Maintenance**: Built-in support for continuous model updates and improvements

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3avaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **AI Model**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) with custom training
- **Platform**: Falcon AI by Duality AI

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 30.9gher
- pip package manager
- Modern web browser

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all files are in the Falcon directory
   # - app.py
   # - index.html
   # - best.pt (YOLOv8 model)
   # - requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd Falcon
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3*Verify model file**
   - Ensure `best.pt` (5.9 is present in the project directory
   - This is the trained YOLOv8 model for space station object detection

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Start the Flask backend**
   ```bash
   cd Falcon
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://12700.1 - The application will load with a modern, space-themed interface

### Using the Application

1. **Upload an Image**
   - ClickChoose Image" to select a `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png` file
   - The file name will be displayed below the button

2. **Detect Objects**
   - Click "Detect Objects to run the YOLOv8 model
   - Wait for the Detecting objects..." message to complete
3 **View Results**
   - Original and detected images will be displayed
   - Bounding boxes show detected objects with class labels
   - Click "Download Annotated Image" to save the result4Learn About Falcon**
   - ClickAbout Falcon" in the navigation to learn about the platform
   - Access official documentation and understand model maintenance

## üåü About Falcon AI Platform

Falcon is an advanced AI platform by Duality AI, designed for rapid development, deployment, and maintenance of computer vision models in real-world environments. It supports multiclass object detection, continuous learning, and seamless integration with applications.

### Model Maintenance with Falcon

The application demonstrates how Falcon can maintain and update models as real-world environments change:

- **Continuous Updates**: Users can flag incorrect detections or upload new images where the model fails
- **Automated Retraining**: New annotated images are added to the training dataset, triggering automated model retraining
- **Adaptation**: The model adapts to new objects or changes in appearance (e.g., new FireExtinguisher colors)
- **Deployment**: Improved models are automatically deployed to the application

### Official Documentation
- [Falcon Object Detection Multiclass Documentation](https://falcon.duality.ai/secure/documentation/ex3-objdetection-multiclass?sidebarMode=learn&utm_source=hackathon&utm_medium=instructions&utm_campaign=algoverse)

## üéØ Use Cases

### Space Station Safety
- Quick verification of safety equipment presence and location
- Emergency response support for locating critical items
- Automated inventory management

### Real-world Applications
- Industrial safety monitoring
- Equipment tracking in controlled environments
- Automated safety compliance checking

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The system is designed for continuous improvement:

1. **Feedback Collection**: Users can report detection errors
2. **Data Augmentation**: New images are collected and annotated
3. **Model Retraining**: Falcon platform handles automated retraining
4loyment**: Updated models are seamlessly deployed

## üìù Technical Details

### Training Configuration
- **Model**: YOLOv8(Ultralytics)
- **Epochs**:50
- **Batch Size**:16
- **Image Size**:640x640
- **Early Stopping**: Patience = 3

### Dataset
- **Format**: YOLO format
- **Classes**: 3 (FireExtinguisher, ToolBox, OxygenTank)
- **Split**: Train/Val/Test with proper distribution

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Detection failed" error**
   - Ensure the Flask backend is running (`python app.py`)
   - Check that `best.pt` is in the correct directory
   - Verify image format (.jpg, .jpeg, .png)2. **CORS errors**
   - Access the app via `http://12700.1/` (not by opening index.html directly)
   - The backend includes CORS support for cross-origin requests

3del loading issues**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check that the `best.pt` file is not corrupted
