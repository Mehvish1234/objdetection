## iii. (Bonus) Use Case Proposal

### 1. Application: FalconVision Object Detection Web App

- **Platform:** Runs on any modern computer or phone via a web browser (no installation required).
- **How it works:**
  - User uploads an image from the space station environment (or a simulation).
  - The app detects and classifies safety-critical objects (FireExtinguisher, ToolBox, OxygenTank) in the image.
  - Results are displayed with bounding boxes and class labels, and the annotated image can be downloaded.
- **Real-world use case:**
  - **Space Station Safety:** Crew or ground control can quickly verify the presence and location of critical safety equipment by uploading images from station cameras.
  - **Inventory Management:** Automated detection helps maintain up-to-date records of tool and equipment locations, reducing manual checks.
  - **Incident Response:** In case of emergencies, the app can help locate fire extinguishers or oxygen tanks instantly from recent images.
- **How to access:**
  - The application is provided as a web app (see included files and instructions). It can be run locally or deployed on a server for remote access.
  - A demonstration video is included in the submission folder, showing the app in action on both desktop and mobile browsers.

### 2. Model Maintenance: Continuous Improvement with Falcon

- **Challenge:** The real-world environment is dynamic. Objects may change appearance, new equipment may be added, or lighting/camera conditions may vary.
- **Falcon's Solution for Model Maintenance:**
  - **Continuous Data Collection:**
    - The Falcon app can be extended to allow users to flag incorrect detections or upload new images where the model fails or is uncertain.
    - These flagged images are collected and reviewed for annotation.
  - **Automated Retraining Pipeline:**
    - New annotated images are periodically added to the training dataset.
    - Falcon can trigger automated retraining of the YOLOv8 model using the updated dataset.
    - The retrained model is validated and, if improved, deployed to the application with minimal downtime.
  - **Adaptation to New Objects:**
    - If a new object (e.g., a new tool) is introduced, Falcon can incorporate new class labels and retrain the model to recognize it.
    - The app can notify users when a new version of the model is available.
  - **Monitoring and Feedback:**
    - The app can log detection confidence and user feedback to identify recurring issues or confusion between classes.
    - This feedback loop ensures the model stays accurate as the environment evolves.
- **Example Scenario:**
  - If the appearance of the FireExtinguisher changes (e.g., new color or shape), users upload new images or flag missed detections.
  - Falcon collects these images, updates the dataset, and retrains the model.
  - The improved model is deployed, and the app now correctly detects the updated FireExtinguisher.
